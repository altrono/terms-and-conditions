IDRIVE SA PRIVACY    POLICY 
============================

Your trust is important to us
Uber's Privacy Principles
When you use Idrive’s services, you trust us with your personal data. We’re committed to keeping that trust, 
and that starts with helping you understand our privacy practices. Our Privacy Principles set the foundation for how we approach privacy at Uber.

### We do the right thing with data.
-----------------------------------
Responsible data management is a prerequisite for continuous innovation. We maintain the value of personal data for Idrive and our users by handling data as users expect, keeping it accurate and complete, 
and properly destroying it when it is no longer needed. This improves our products, earns and keeps our users’ trust, and differentiates us in the market.

We collect only what we need.
-----------------------------
We have a specific objective in mind when collecting, using, or handling personal data that is consistent with our objectives and values.
We collect and use only the amount of personal data we need for approved and lawful purposes.

We build privacy into our products from start to finish.
-------------------------------------------------------
Privacy is an important component for building world-class products and services, from inception to rollout and beyond. 
Performing privacy reviews on new and changed products, technologies, and services makes
sure they fulfill users’ expectations and forms the bedrock of an exceptional customer experience. This is called “privacy-by-design.”


We give users choices about their data.
---------------------------------------
We give users clear choices about their privacy and controls that are easy to use so that they can manage their data.
